                My name is Benjamin Bullitt Schmechel. This is a place I’ve begun to put the photographs I’ve taken and other things I’ve
                made or written over the last few years. This page is a place where I’d like to tell a little bit about my background or
                story or make some kind of helpful introduction. There might be a picture of me here, though I’m not sure about that yet.

            </p>

                There will certainly be space for expressing gratitude, and for providing hypertext links to the websites of other artists
                and friends.

            </p>
            <p>
                I think there may also be a discrete/or not so discrete place here for making contact.
